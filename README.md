# Bakery_Sales_Predictions
My bakery sales Prediction
I opened my business in July of 2020, since then, my sales have been some months down and some months up, I would like to know what are the main factors that make my sales go up and down and what insights can I get from all the data so far collected from my sales and social media to increase my sales, what month should be the marketing target and why? what are the results of my social media marketing? Is this affecting my sales by month? I have a lot of questions that can be answered with this project. So far I have been sending promotions, and paying Facebook to boosting posts that I am not sure that are resulting in sales, So far I donâ€™t know where most of my website visitors come from, or how often I do a sale. This project will be helpful for my small and new business to make it growth (and now if its growing) and address my efforts where I really need it. 
This project is a work in process, I'm using Jupyter Notebook and tableau for visualizations
