# Bakery_Sales_Predictions

The goal of this project is to predict a Home-Based Bakery, using data provided by the business I aim to predict net sales based on the information collected from previous sales and website traffic behavior, it is also within the scope of this project to use graph analysis to draw a data driven marketing strategy. Next sections will take you through the process of collecting, cleaning, formatting, organizing, and plotting the data, to finally propose three models to predict sales, Linear Regression, K Nearest Neighbor and ARIMA, from these models the results of root mean squared error are as follow, ARIMA result a RMSE of 0.89, Linear regression model 0.064, and KNN result on a RMSE 0.88. The deployment of any of these models would be decision of the Bakery owners, predictions for the three models are presented in this paper.
